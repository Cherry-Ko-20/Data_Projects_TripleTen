# Predicting Car Prices for Rusty Bargain A Machine Learning Approach

This project is an individual undertaking, meaning that it is being carried out by a single person working independently, without collaboration or group involvement.

## Project Description

Rusty Bargain used car sales service is developing an app to attract new customers. Within this application, users can efficiently ascertain the market value of their cars using available historical data, encompassing technical specifications, trim versions, and corresponding prices. The project's objective is to construct a model that facilitates the accurate determination of a car's value.

Rusty Bargain is interested in:

-The quality of the prediction

-The speed of the prediction

-The time required for training

## Goal

The goal is to quickly determine the market value of a car based on historical data, technical specifications, trim versions, and prices. The project involves building machine learning models, including linear regression, random forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost, to evaluate the quality and speed of predictions. The emphasis is on comparing different gradient boosting methods and other algorithms, considering hyperparameter tuning and encoding of categorical features. The analysis aims to provide insights into the most effective models for predicting car prices.
