# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp.

| Project Number | Title | Discribtion |
| :------------: | ------| ------------|
| 1 | Gold Recovery Prediction and Analysis | This project focuses on predicting the gold recovery process in a mining industry context. The goal is to develop a predictive Machine Learning model that estimates the efficiency of the gold recovery process at different stages and provides insights into the concentrations of various metals. |
| 2 | Oil Well Location Optimization for OilyGiant Mining Company | This project involves determining the optimal location for a new oil well for the OilyGiant mining company. The final goal is to recommend a region for oil well development that maximizes average profit while keeping the risk of losses below 2.5%. |
| 3 | Customer Churn Prediction for Beta Bank | This project addresses Beta Bank's challenge of customer churn by developing a machine learning model to predict which customers are likely to leave the bank.|
| 4 | Megaline Telecommunications Usage Analysis and Revenue Optimization | This project centers on analyzing the usage behavior of Megaline's Surf and Ultimate prepaid plan subscribers to determine which plan yields higher revenue in order to provide insights for adjusting the advertising budget effectively.|
| 5 | Megaline's Mobile Plan Recommendation System | Megaline, a leading mobile carrier, initiated a project to enhance subscriber satisfaction by recommending personalized mobile plans. The objective was to predict whether subscribers should switch to either the 'Smart' or 'Ultra' plan based on their behavior. |
| 6 | Taxi Ride Data for Zuber's Launch in Chicago | The analysis provided valuable insights into taxi company performance, popular neighborhoods, and the influence of weather on ride durations. |
| 7 | Analyzing Video Game Sales for Strategic Advertising Planning at Ice Online Store | In this project, we explore into data analytics for Ice, an online store specializing in global video game sales. The goal is to identify patterns in platform popularity, genre profitability, regional preferences, and the impact of reviews on game sales.|
| 8 | Instacart Orders Exploratory Data Analysis | This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Instacart's order data with the objective of extracting valuable insights into customer shopping behaviors by identifying the most prevalent time of day for grocery shopping, examining the distribution of orders across days of the week, assessing the proportion of reordered products for individual customers, and determining the top 20 items that customers add to their carts first.|
| 9 | Machine Learning Applications in Sure Tomorrow Insurance Company | Sure Tomorrow, an insurance company, aims to leverage machine learning for various tasks. The project involves using linear algebra and ML to solve four key tasks: finding similar customers, predicting insurance benefits, using linear regression, and ensuring data privacy through data masking. The tasks demand data preprocessing, model development, and securing personal information.|
| 10 | Predicting Car Prices for Rusty Bargain: A Machine Learning Approach | This Rusty Bargain project aims to build a model for quickly determining car market values based on historical data, using machine learning models like linear regression, random forest, LightGBM, CatBoost, and XGBoost. The focus is on evaluating prediction quality, speed, and training time, emphasizing gradient boosting methods. Insights will guide the selection of the most effective models for accurate and efficient car price predictions.|
| 11 | Building a Robust Model for Classifying Film Reviews | The goal of this project is to develop a sentiment analysis model for movie reviews. The project specifically aims to identify negative movie reviews using machine learning techniques. The dataset provided includes IMDb movie reviews labeled with polarity (positive or negative).|
