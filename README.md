# Data_Projects_TripleTen
Projects I worked on while attending the Triple Ten Data Science Bootcamp.

| Project Number | Title | Discribtion |
| :------------: | ------| ------------|
| 1 | Gold Recovery Prediction and Analysis | This project focuses on predicting the gold recovery process in a mining industry context. The goal is to develop a predictive Machine Learning model that estimates the efficiency of the gold recovery process at different stages and provides insights into the concentrations of various metals. |
| 2 | Oil Well Location Optimization for OilyGiant Mining Company | This project involves determining the optimal location for a new oil well for the OilyGiant mining company. The final goal is to recommend a region for oil well development that maximizes average profit while keeping the risk of losses below 2.5%. |
