# Megalines Mobile Plan Recommendation System

This project is an individual undertaking, meaning that it is being carried out by a single person working independently, without collaboration or group involvement.

## Project description

Mobile carrier Megaline has found out that many of their subscribers use legacy plans. They want to develop a model that would analyze subscribers' behavior and recommend one of Megaline's newer plans: Smart or Ultra. 

## Goal

Megaline, a leading mobile carrier, initiated a project to enhance subscriber satisfaction by recommending personalized mobile plans. The objective was to develop a model with the highest possible accuracy to predict whether subscribers should switch to either the 'Smart' or 'Ultra' plan based on their behavior.


## Data description

Every observation in the dataset contains monthly behavior information about one user. The information given is as follows: 

-`—Åalls` : number of calls,

-`minutes` : total call duration in minutes,

-`messages` : number of text messages,

-`mb_used` : Internet traffic used in MB,

-`is_ultra` : plan for the current month (Ultra - 1, Smart - 0).
