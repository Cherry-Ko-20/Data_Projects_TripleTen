# Instacar Orders Exploratory Data Analysis

This project is an individual undertaking, meaning that it is being carried out by a single person working independently, without collaboration or group involvement.

## Project Description

This project focuses on conducting an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Instacart's order data with the objective of extracting valuable insights into customer shopping behaviors. The analysis will encompass several key aspects, including identifying the most prevalent time of day for grocery shopping, examining the distribution of orders across days of the week, assessing the proportion of reordered products for individual customers, and determining the top 20 items that customers add to their carts first.
